# MY WEB PORTFOLIO 

I am Samuel and I am 21 years old and come from Germany. 

I am a trained electrician. I realy enjoy to take photos and flying with my self-built FPV copter. I relax while programming small web or local apps. 

Because I always share my hobbies and instragam is too standard, I decided on my personal portfolio website. 

# A website is under construction;)
